                    <p>I am a graduate student at NYU majoring in Computer Science and specializing in Deep Learning. 
                        I am a tinker and technologist at heart and I love learning new technologies through weekend projects like this 
                        website I put together to learn React.js.  
                    </p>
                    <p>When I am not busy geeking around, I dance. I am a trained dancer in the beautiful Indian classical dance form Kathak.</p>
